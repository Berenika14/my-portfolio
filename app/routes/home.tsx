              I am originally from Kosovo, immigrated to the United States at
              age 20 on my own. A transition that helped me gain a global
              mindset, developed my cultural awareness and engraved the
              adaptability skill in me.

            <p className="mt-6 opacity-50 mb:text-lg">
              My passion for programming began in the summer of 2021. It was
              late July when it happened - the first time I witnessed an open
              code editor. Scrolling through src/messages/index.ts for what felt
              a few short seconds, I was interrupted by the computer‚Äôs owner:
              ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been standing here watching you stare at that screen for at
              least 60 seconds and you didn‚Äôt even notice.‚Äù
              <br />
              This was the moment I caught the bug. In the coming months, I
              would withdrew from my college to take a risk on learning this
              craft that had transfixed me months earlier. I enrolled in an
              intensive 6-month training course to kickstart my career as a
              programmer.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-8 opacity-50 mb:text-lg ">
              My decision to pursue software development was born from a naive
              fascination of the craft. As a result, the ‚Äúwork‚Äù really feels
              more like play, and spending time on perfecting my skills and
              improving my code feels more like a privilege than a chore. I‚Äôm
              excited to leverage this passion to help companies build amazing
              products and to build friendships with like-minded passionate
              people
